## Getting started
1. Download the version on Lens Studio mentioned in this README
2. Make sure your DPK has firmware version `hax13`  
    - This is important due this one having pinch, tap and double tap
3. In DPK choose the following
    1. Model: `26D + 1`
    2. BL MODE: `SDK`


## Project Setup
1. Open the project 
2. In TouchSdk script Inspector write your `Watch Name` , this should match the name of your DPK

## Sending the Lens
1. Connect Spectacles to your phone
2. Connect Spectacles to Lens Studio
3. Send the Lens to your Spectacles and turn on your DPK


## Other notes
- Sometimes you need to accept the connection on your DPK - `press Y`
- To use Bluetooth API you need to have `Experimental API on` in your project settings
